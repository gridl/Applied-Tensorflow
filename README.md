A repository containing practical examples on how to use tensorflow.
In the file ```Tensor Flow first steps_v2.ipynb``` a basic tutorial on the use
of tensorflow is presented to show the reader how to do basic regression
on some simple dataset.

I show how to detec overfitting, how to simply apply dropout, how to
do basic linear regression and more complicated regression with networks with
more neurons.
